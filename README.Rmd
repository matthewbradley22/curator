# curator

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of curator is to provide an accessible way for biologists to curate biological datasets.
Specifically, the package provides functions to flag suspicious observations based on location,
name, and species. It also provides an easy way to map observations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of curator from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matthewbradley22/curator")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(curator)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat = get_records_since_date(100)
flags = flag_data(dat)
flags$plotNum = flags_for_map(flags)
map_flags(flags)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
